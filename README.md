## 🔗 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint          | Description    |
| ------ | ----------------- | -------------- |
| POST   | /api/register     | Register user  |
| POST   | /api/login        | Login user     |
| POST   | /api/upload       | Upload file    |
| GET    | /api/public-files | Get all files  |
| GET    | /api/my-files     | Get user files |
| DELETE | /api/files/:id    | Delete file    |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User registers and logs in
2. Server generates JWT token
3. Token is stored in browser (localStorage)
4. User uploads file → stored in server + MongoDB
5. Files can be viewed/downloaded
6. Only owner can delete their files

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights

* Full-stack application (Frontend + Backend)
* Secure authentication system
* Real-time cloud deployment
* Clean and responsive UI
* Role-based access control

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

* Files stored on server (temporary storage in free hosting)
* No file preview (only download)
* Basic UI (can be enhanced further)

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* File preview (PDF viewer, video player)
* Drag & drop upload
* File sharing via links
* User profile system
* Storage optimization using AWS S3 / Cloudinary
